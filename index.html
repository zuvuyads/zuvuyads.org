                    <p>The structure of the Zuvuya House System is simplicity itself. By using a Kin # and Tone it can easily be converted into an Astrological equation that lays the framework for your core chart.</p>

                    <p>"Zuvuya is the circuit by which everything returns to itself. That is a metaphysical cruncher. Another way you could say this is that everything is a memory of itself." — Jose Arguelles</p>

                    <h3>From Inside Out</h3>
                    <p>We read from the inside out because your soul doesn't receive motion — it remembers it. The houses become experiential zones shaped by the Kin Tribe, each reflecting a distinct pattern of perception that unfolds cyclically.</p>

                <h3>The Tzolk'in</h3>
                <p>The Tzolk'in combines 20 day signs with 13 tones, creating a 260-day sacred calendar that has guided seekers for millennia in understanding cosmic patterns and personal energy.</p>
                
                <h3>The Mayan Long Count</h3>
                <p>The Mayan Long Count is part of the classical Mayan Calendrical system rooted deeply in the Mayan Civilization. Historically used for tracking large cycles of time over thousands of years. Its starting point is 0.0.0.0.0 corresponding to August 11th 3114 BC, Gregorian Calendar.</p>
                
                <h3>The Dreamspell Count</h3>
                <p>The Dreamspell is a modern reinterpretation of the Tzolk'in with spiritual and harmonic goals. Created by Jose and Lloydine Arguelles, it began on July 26th 1987 aligning with the heliacal rising of Sirius.

                <h3>Houses: Sacred Geometry of Memory</h3>
                <p>Zuvuya Houses are like a sacred geometry of memory guided by the 13 tones and 20 Galactic Tribes or Solar Seals. They act as living stages in the arising of awareness anchored in memory, movement and timing.</p>
                
                <h3>Planets: Resonant Mirrors</h3>
                <p>Traditional Astrology calculates planetary placements by time and place, producing a wheel that orientates the self in space. Zuvuya repositions planetary placements and orientates the self in time memory, with a spiral that begins with the soul's tone and tribe forming the inner ring of meaning.</p>
                
                <h3>Wave of Return</h3>
                <p>In Zuvuya, your planetary placements are not read as causal agents but as resonant mirrors of memory. Save time and discover your own unique resonant pattern now!</p>

                    <h3>Why doesn't Zuvuya require my birth time?</h3>
                    <p>Unlike traditional astrology, the Zuvuya House System does not require birth time or place to generate your core chart. However, planetary placements are a crucial element and benefit from knowing your time and place of birth for enhanced accuracy.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>What if I don't know my birth time?</h3>
                    <p>If you don't have exact time and/or place of birth, a core Zuvuya chart can still be generated. In that case, planetary positions are calculated for solar noon and a default location, providing a reliable overview of your Zuvuya motion pattern.</p>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>How does Zuvuya differ from other astrological systems?</h3>
                    <p>Zuvuya repositions planetary placements within a framework that integrates Mayan calendar wisdom. We read from the inside out because the soul doesn't receive motion — it remembers it.</p>
