                </blockquote>

                <p>By merging 2 systems of Ageless Wisdom, Zuvuya offers a unique and innovative approach for those who are drawn to the deeper rhythms of Astrology, the Mayan Tzolkin, and carry a genuine spark of cosmic curiosity.</p>
                <p>It is designed to enhance astrological configurations and insights into an expanded view within the Wisdom inherent in the Mayan Tzolkin.</p>
                <p>It leads with a "Galactic Edge" by using the Kin Solar Seal # (1-260) and Tone # (1-13) as the foundation for the core chart. The traditional astrological template is used to create a visual interplay between the 12/60 basis of Astrology and 13/20 cycle of the Tzolkin.</p>
                
                <p><strong>The Zuvuya Core Chart is not seen as a wheel of fate but as a wave of return.</strong></p>
                <p>In Zuvuya, the core chart is seen as a wave of return. Not as a wheel of fate. A wave that is seeded by memory through the 20 Solar Seals, moved by resonance through the 13 Tones and guided by timing through Planetary cycles.</p>

                <h3>Creating the Core Chart is the Doorway</h3>

                <blockquote>
                    <p>“Astrology maps the sky around you. Zuvuya maps the harmonic sequence.”</p>
                </blockquote>

                <p>Traditional astrology builds your chart based on the rotation of the Earth.<br>
                Your birth time and place determine what part of the sky was rising on the horizon (Ascendant).</p>

                <p>Zuvuya does not use the Earth’s rotation. It builds from the repeating mathematical sequence of 13/20 and repositions planetary placements within the 260 day harmonic count. This orientates the Soul self (or Galactic self) in cycles of time memory (wave spells), with a spiral that begins with a Tone and Solar Seal.</p>

                <p>The houses become the Solar Seal zones. They act as stages of arising awareness, each reflecting a distinct pattern of perception, anchored by memory (Solar Seal), moved by resonance (Tone 1-13) and timing by Planetary cycles.</p>
                <blockquote>
                    <p>"….while any day represents a particular tone or quality, it also has overtones. Properly tuned into, the quality of the day can lead to experiences in other octaves, and other dimensions. Though this view bears some analogy to Astrology the meaning is somewhat different because the numbers are cued to galactic harmonics, rather than, or as well as, to planetary cycles."</p>

            <h2 id="mayan-calendar-heading">The Mayan Long Count and the Dreamspell Count</h2>
            <div class="content-section">
                <p>The Mayan Long Count and the Dreamspell Count are two distinct counts rooted in the Mayan Tzolkin yet they differ in structure and origin.</p>

                <h3>The Mayan Long Count</h3>
                <p>The Mayan Long Count is a part of the Classical Mayan Calendric system. Its epoch began on 0.0.0.0.0. corresponding to August 11th 3114 BC (Gregorian Calendar) and September 6th 3114 BCE (Julian Calendar).</p>
                <p>Historically, the Mayan Long Count was used as a continuous calendar system to record exact dates across long periods of time.<br>
                The Maya documented dynastic events, monument dedications, rituals and mythic origins with a precision far beyond cyclical calendars.</p>

                <h3>The Dreamspell Count</h3>
                <p><span class="dreamspell-attribution">Dreamspell: The Journey of Timeship Earth was designed by Jose and Lloydine Arguelles in 1990.</span></p>
                
                <p>Introducing new concepts and terminology, the Dreamspell became a cornerstone of the New Age Movement, giving rise to the Harmonic Convergence (August 16th/17th 1987). It is a more idealized and non-linear perspective, designed for spiritual exploration and global harmony. Its epoch began on July 26th 1987, aligning with the heliacal rising of Sirius.</p>
                <p>The heliacal rising of Sirius is an annual event and occurs at its first reappearance in the sky after a period of being hidden by the Suns glare.</p>

                <h3>“The Best of Both Worlds.”</h3>
                <p>The next step for Zuvuya is to become digital.</p>
                <p>Sean Dinwiddie will be taking the digital lead. Options will be added so anyone using the Zuvuya House System will be able to create a chart utilizing the same STANDARD OPTIONS (transits, progressions, composites, solar and lunar returns) that are found on most astrological sites.</p>
                <p>Sean will begin by digitalizing the core foundation, making both the Dreamspell and the Mayan Long Count available. We’ll decide in what order to add the options, eventually making it a full service house system.</p>
                <p>Until the app is complete I’m offering walk thrus for those who are interested in seeing how their planetary pattern inter-acts within the harmonic matrix of the Tzolkin. Please use the contact information listed below.</p>

                <h3>Birth Time and Place</h3>
                <p>While your Zuvuya core chart doesn't require birth time or place, knowing the time and place of your birth adds the important element of planetary accuracy.</p>
                <p>If this information isn't available, planetary positions are calculated for solar noon and a default location providing a reliable overview of your Tzolkin/Mayan cycle.</p>

                </blockquote>
                <p>I bought my first two astrology books at the Theosophical Bookstore on Capitol Hill in Seattle Washington.</p>
                <p>Esoteric Astrology scribed by Alice Bailey and The Encyclopedia of Medical Astrology by H.L. Cornell M.D.</p>
                <p>Anyone can read Esoteric Astrology. There are no glyphs, no symbols, no astrological equations, and it presents astrology in such a way as to turn most traditional views of astrology on its head. It was a good place to start.</p>
                <p>This was not the case with the Encyclopedia of Medical Astrology.</p>
                <p>The Encyclopedia is a mix of words, descriptions and astrological correlations none of which I had a clue about.</p>
                <p>Seattle was my hometown, I knew the area well and went looking for an Astrology 101 class.</p>
                <p>Astrology Et Al had a storefront in the University District. I was shown a list of the classes they were offering, and Jeff Green’s class caught my eye.</p>
                <p>Before I bought my first two astrology books, I had been Gurdjieff-ing. My first husband and I were a part of a Gurdjieff group and coming from that background a class on Evolutionary Astrology was much more appealing than the 101 series.</p>
                <p>I asked if I could sign up for Jeff's class and was discouraged from doing so. It was suggested that until I took a basic course it might be too difficult to understand.</p>
                <p>I had no intention of following that suggestion. I showed up on the night of his class and asked if I could sit in even with my limited understanding of astrology. He said fine so I took a seat.</p>
                <p>Jeff was 7 years away from catching the wave to fame. His classes were lightly attended. I asked a lot of questions that usually began with “What do you mean by.....”</p>
                <p>We became a couple shortly after.</p>
                <p>I attended numerous astrology conferences and met some very fine and diverse astrologers, but I was never drawn to become a practicing professional astrologer.</p>
                <p>In 1985 Pluto: The Evolutionary Journey of the Soul was published. It was outstandingly well received. Jeff became in high demand as a speaker, the Pluto book was translated into several languages and became a fixture in the astrological hall of fame.</p>
                <p>In 1988 we separated and I relocated to Northern California.</p>
                <p>I was gifted The Dreamspell in 1993.<br>
                What I hadn’t been able to find thru Astrology I found thru the Dreamspell.</p>

                <p>Nowadays we often hear the call to “remember” who we are. That we have both
                a family lineage and a cosmic or galactic lineage. Both Astrology and the Dreamspell offer a way to evoke this remembrance and validate experiences that arise from refined awareness.</p>

                <p>By utilizing the familiar astrological template and repositioning planetary placements in relationship to the Mayan Tzolkin, a path is created for astrologers to glean insight from an alternative and harmonically based foundation.</p>

                <p>It provides a unified framework for those drawn to the study of Astrology in search of their own unique insights and simplifies the complexity of the Dreamspell.
                By setting the foundation of the chart in accordance with the Mayan Tzolkin and not the time and place of birth, the Zuvuya House System is more suited and reflective of the movement of Pluto into Aquarius,
                Uranus into Gemini and Neptune into Aries.</p>
