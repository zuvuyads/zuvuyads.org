            <div class="content-section">
                <p>Zuvuya represents a unique and innovative fusion of 2 ancient systems offering a fresh approach for Astrologers and Mayan Calendar enthusiasts as well.</p>
                <p>It is designed to integrate Astrological insights within the 260 day Tzolkin, the Wisdom inherent in the Mayan Calendar.</p>
                <p>It leads with a "Galactic Edge" by using the Kins Solar Seal # (1-260) and Tone (1-13). This lays the foundation for the core chart.</p>
                <p>Just as you might translate a word in search for a deeper meaning, Zuvuya translates Astrological configurations and Mayan cycles into a unified field using the traditional astrological template.</p>

                <p>Planetary positions are placed within the framework (Tzolkin) that orientates the soul self in "time memory" with a spiral that begins with a Tone and Seal.</p>
                <p>These positions enhance astrological configurations into an expanded view. They are not seen as causal agents but as resonant mirrors, reflecting the soul self within time memory.</p>

            <div class="content-section">
                <p>The Mayan Long Count and Dreamspell Count are 2 distinct systems for measuring time within the MesoAmerican calendars. Both systems offer unique insights yet they differ in origin and structure.</p>
                
                <h3>The Dreamspell Count</h3>
                <p>Dreamspell: The Journey of Timeship Earth was designed by Jose and Lloydine Arguelles introducing new terminology and spiritual concepts not present in the traditional Mayan system. It became a cornerstone of the New Age Movement and gave rise to the Harmonic Convergence August 16th and 17th 1987.</p>
                <p>It's a more idealized and non-linear perspective designed for spiritual exploration and global harmony. Its epoch began on July 26th 1987 aligning with the heliacal rising of Sirius.</p>
                
                <h3>The Mayan Long Count</h3>
                <p>The Mayan Long Count is part of the Classical Mayan calendrical system. It's epoch is 0.0.0.0.0. corresponding to August 11th 3114 BC (Gregorian Calendar) and September 6th 3114 BCE (Julian Calendar).</p>
                <p>Rooted deeply in the Mayan Civilisation and historically used for recording dates in monuments and texts over thousands of years.</p>

                <h3>Houses: Sacred Geometry of Memory</h3>
                <p>Zuvuya Houses are like a sacred geometry of memory guided by the 13 tones and 20 Galactic Tribes or Solar Seals. They act as living stages in the arising of awareness anchored in memory, movement and timing.</p>
                
                <h3>Planets: Resonant Mirrors</h3>
                <p>Traditional Astrology calculates planetary placements by time and place, producing a wheel that orientates the self in space. Zuvuya repositions planetary placements and orientates the self in time memory, with a spiral that begins with the soul's tone and tribe forming the inner ring of meaning.</p>
                
                <h3>Tones 1-13: Your Cosmic Music</h3>
                <p>"...to follow the musical analogy, while any day represents a particular tone or number (1-13), it also has its overtones. Properly tuned into, then, the quality of the day can lead to experiences in other octaves, in other dimensions of being. Though this view bears some analogy to astrology, the meaning is somewhat different because the numbers are cued to the galactic harmonics, rather than, or as well as, to planetary cycles."</p>
                <p>— J. Arguelles, <i>The Mayan Factor: The Path Beyond Technology</i>, pg. 66</p>
                
                <h3>Wave of Return</h3>
                <p>In Zuvuya, your planetary placements are not read as causal agents but as resonant mirrors of memory. Save time and discover your own unique resonant pattern now!</p>

            <div class="content-section">
                <p>Zuvuya represents a groundbreaking fusion of two ancient systems, offering a fresh approach for astrologers and Mayan calendar enthusiasts alike.</p>
                <p>This app allows you to access through the traditional astrological template a visual representation of the interplay between Mayan and Astrological systems.</p>
                <p>In Zuvuya, a chart is not a wheel of fate — it's a wave of return. We read from the inside out because the soul doesn't receive motion, it remembers it.</p>

                <blockquote>
                    <p>"...while any day represents a particular tone or number, it also has overtones. Properly tuned into then, the quality of the day can lead to experiences in other octaves, in other dimensions. Though this view bears some analogy to astrology, the meaning is somewhat different because the numbers are cued to the galactic harmonics, rather than, or as well as, to planetary cycles."</p>

                <h3>Creating the Core Chart is the Doorway</h3>
                <p>It reveals how in the Zuvuya House System a core chart is not seen as a wheel of fate but as a wave of return. A wave that is seeded by memory through the 20 Solar Seals, moved by resonance through the 13 Tones and guided by timing through planetary cycles.</p>
