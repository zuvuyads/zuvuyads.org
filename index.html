            <div class="content-section">
                <p>By merging 2 systems of Ageless Wisdom, Zuvuya offers a unique and innovative approach for those who are drawn to the deeper rhythms of Astrology, the Mayan Tzolkin, and carry a genuine spark of cosmic curiosity.</p>
                <p>It is designed to enhance astrological configurations and insights into an expanded view within the 260 day Tzolkin, the Wisdom inherent in the Mayan Tzolkin</p>
                <p>It leads with a "Galactic Edge" by using the Kin Solar Seal # (1-260) and Tone# (1-13) as the foundation for the core chart. The traditional astrological template is used to create a visual interplay between the 12/60 basis of Astrology and 13/20 cycle of the Tzolkin</p>
                <p>The Zuvuya Core Chart is not seen as wheel of fate but at a wave of return. We view it from the inside out because the soul doesn't receive motion, it remembers it.</p>
                <blockquote>
                    <p>"…Zuvuya is the circuit by which everything returns to itself. That is a metaphysical cruncher. Another way you could say this is that everything is a memory of itself"</p>

                <p><strong>Zuvuya is the key to Cosmic Override</strong></p>
                <p>Traditional astrology calculates planetary positions by time and place producing a wheel that orientates the soul self in space.</p>
                <p>Zuvuya repositions planetary placements within the harmonic count (Tzolkin) orientating the soul self in cycles of time memory (wave spells).</p>
                <p>The houses become the Solar Seal zones cyclically unfolding. They act as living stages of arising awareness each reflecting a distinct pattern of perception, anchored by memory (Solar Seal), moved by resonance (Tone 1-13) and timing by planetary cycles.</p>
                <blockquote>
                    <p>"….while any day represents a particular tone or quality, it also has overtones. Properly tuned into, the quality of the day can lead to experiences in other octaves, other dimensions. Though this view bears some analogy to Astrology the meaning is somewhat different because the numbers are cued to galactic harmonics, rather than, or as well as, to planetary cycles."</p>

                </blockquote>
                <p>I was gifted the Dreamspell in 1992.</p>
                <p>In 1978 I met Jeff Green who would later become quite famous after his first book Pluto: The Evolutionary Journey of the Soul was published in 1985.</p>
                <p>Our meeting was quite happenstance and rather humorous. I had purchased Esoteric Astrology and The Encyclopedia of Medical Astrology at a Theosophical Bookstore in Seattle Washington.</p>
                <p>Reading Esoteric Astrology (AABailey) didn't require any knowledge of the symbols, signs, or aspects relative to astrology.</p>
                <p>The Encyclopedia of Medical Astrology was a different story.</p>
                <p>It is an exhaustive study. Mind boggling in contemplating what must have gone into such an undertaking and I couldn't make head nor tails out of the symbols or signs.</p>
                <p>I went hunting for an Astrology 101 class and one day walked into Astrology Et Al which had a storefront in the University District.</p>
                <p>That was in 1978.</p>
                <p>I was shown the list of classes they offered and Evolutionary Astrology caught my eye. I asked about signing up for Jeff's class and was told rather sternly that it would better if I took a beginners class first. I noted the time and day of Jeff's class and well, I just showed up. I asked Jeff if I could sit in on his class given my limited understanding of astrology and he said fine. So I sat with about 6 or 7 other students well before he caught the wave to fame.</p>
                <p>While with Jeff I attended many astrology conferences and met some very fine and diverse astrologers I was never drawn to pursue astrology as a profession.</p>
                <p>We separated in 1988, I relocated to Northern California and continued my self guided study of astrology until I was gifted the Dreamspell.</p>
                <p>What I hadn't found through my extensive astrological studies I found through the Dreamspell. In much the same way I approached studying astrology, I began studying the Dreamspell. In April of 2024 I put the two together and created the Zuvuya House System.</p>
                <p>In my mind this house system is a natural and much needed progression in astrological thought and simplifies the complexity of the Dreamspell.</p>
                <p>I am very pleased to be able to introduce it.</p>

Consequently, for a warrior there is no end to the mystery of being, whether being means a pebble, or an ant, or oneself. That is the warriors humbleness. One is equal to everything."</p>

                <p>While your Zuvuya core chart doesn't require birth time or place, knowing the time and place of your birth adds the important element of planetary accuracy.</p>
                <p>If this information isn't available, planetary positions are calculated for solar noon and a default location providing a reliable overview of your Zuvuya motion pattern.</p>

            <h2 id="mayan-calendar-heading">The Mayan Long Count and the Dreamspell Count</h2>
            <div class="content-section">
                <p>The Mayan Long Count and the Dreamspell Count are two distinct counts rooted in the Mayan Tzolkin yet differ in structure and origin.</p>
                
                <h3>The Mayan Long Count</h3>
                <p>The Mayan Long Count is a part of the Classical Mayan Calendric system. Its epoch began on 0.0.0.0.0. corresponding to August 11th 3114 BC (Gregorian Calendar) and September 6th 3114 BCE (Julian Calendar).</p>
                <p>It's been used historically for recording dates and texts that can be found in monuments dating back thousands of years.</p>
                
                <h3>The Dreamspell Count</h3>
                <p>Dreamspell : The Journey of Timeship Earth was designed by Jose and Lloydine Arguelles.</p>
                <p>Introducing new concepts and spiritual terminology not present in the traditional Mayan system, it became a cornerstone of the New Age Movement giving rise to the Harmonic Convergence August 16th and 17th 1987. Considered by some to be a more idealized and non-linear perspective, designed for spiritual exploration and global harmony, its epoch began on July 26th 1987 aligning with the heliacal rising of Sirius.</p>
                <p>The heliacal rising of Sirius is an annual event and occurs at its first reappearance in the sky after a period of being hidden by the Suns glare.</p>

            <div class="content-section">
                <h3>Houses: Sacred Geometry of Memory</h3>
                <p>Zuvuya Houses are like a sacred geometry of memory guided by the 13 tones and 20 Galactic Tribes or Solar Seals. They act as living stages in the arising of awareness anchored in memory, movement and timing.</p>
                
                <h3>Planets: Resonant Mirrors</h3>
                <p>Traditional Astrology calculates planetary placements by time and place, producing a wheel that orientates the self in space. Zuvuya repositions planetary placements and orientates the self in time memory, with a spiral that begins with the soul's tone and tribe forming the inner ring of meaning.</p>
                
                <h3>Tones 1-13: Your Cosmic Music</h3>
                <p>"...to follow the musical analogy, while any day represents a particular tone or number (1-13), it also has its overtones. Properly tuned into, then, the quality of the day can lead to experiences in other octaves, in other dimensions of being. Though this view bears some analogy to astrology, the meaning is somewhat different because the numbers are cued to the galactic harmonics, rather than, or as well as, to planetary cycles."</p>
                <p>— J. Arguelles, <i>The Mayan Factor: The Path Beyond Technology</i>, pg. 66</p>
                
                <h3>Wave of Return</h3>
                <p>In Zuvuya, your planetary placements are not read as causal agents but as resonant mirrors of memory. Save time and discover your own unique resonant pattern now!</p>
