                <p>By merging 2 systems of Ageless Wisdom, Zuvuya offers a unique and innovative approach for those who are drawn to the deeper rhythms of Astrology, the Mayan Tzolkin, and carry a genuine spark of cosmic curiosity.</p>
                <p>It is designed to enhance astrological configurations and insights into an expanded view within the 260 day Tzolkin, the Wisdom inherent in the Mayan Tzolkin</p>
                <p>It leads with a "Galactic Edge" by using the Kin Solar Seal # (1-260) and Tone# (1-13) as the foundation for the core chart. The traditional astrological template is used to create a visual interplay between the 12/60 basis of Astrology and 13/20 cycle of the Tzolkin</p>
                <p><span class="zuvuya-gold">The Zuvuya Core Chart is not seen as a wheel of fate but as a wave of return.</span></p>
                <p>Traditional astrology calculates planetary positions by time and place producing a wheel that orientates the soul self in space.</p>
                <p>Zuvuya repositions planetary placements within the harmonic count (Tzolkin) orientating the soul self in cycles of time memory (wave spells).</p>
                <p>The houses become the Solar Seal zones cyclically unfolding. They act as living stages of arising awareness each reflecting a distinct pattern of perception, anchored by memory (Solar Seal), moved by resonance (Tone 1-13) and timing by planetary cycles.</p>
                <blockquote>
                    <p>"….while any day represents a particular tone or quality, it also has overtones. Properly tuned into, the quality of the day can lead to experiences in other octaves, other dimensions. Though this view bears some analogy to Astrology the meaning is somewhat different because the numbers are cued to galactic harmonics, rather than, or as well as, to planetary cycles."</p>

            <h2 id="mayan-calendar-heading">The Mayan Long Count and the Dreamspell Count</h2>
            <div class="content-section">
                <p>The Mayan Long Count and the Dreamspell Count are two distinct counts rooted in the Mayan Tzolkin yet differ in structure and origin.</p>
                
                <h3>The Mayan Long Count</h3>
                <p>The Mayan Long Count is a part of the Classical Mayan Calendric system. Its epoch began on 0.0.0.0.0. corresponding to August 11th 3114 BC (Gregorian Calendar) and September 6th 3114 BCE (Julian Calendar).</p>
                <p>It's been used historically for recording dates and texts that can be found in monuments dating back thousands of years.</p>
                
                <h3>The Dreamspell Count</h3>
                <p>Dreamspell : The Journey of Timeship Earth was designed by Jose and Lloydine Arguelles.</p>
                <p>Introducing new concepts and spiritual terminology not present in the traditional Mayan system, it became a cornerstone of the New Age Movement giving rise to the Harmonic Convergence August 16th and 17th 1987. Considered by some to be a more idealized and non-linear perspective, designed for spiritual exploration and global harmony, its epoch began on July 26th 1987 aligning with the heliacal rising of Sirius.</p>
                <p>The heliacal rising of Sirius is an annual event and occurs at its first reappearance in the sky after a period of being hidden by the Suns glare.</p>

            <div class="content-section">
                <h3>A full service house system</h3>
                <p>Currently on Astrodienst 23 house systems are listed. Whichever house system you prefer a chart can be calculated in a number of different ways. On Astrodienst you have over 40 options for calculations.</p>
                <p>Since this is the direction I'm planning to take Zuvuya the next step is to turn Zuvuya digital.</p>
                <p>Sean Dinwiddie will be taking the digital lead. We will add options so that anyone using the Zuvuya House System will be able to create a chart utilizing the same STANDARD OPTIONS (transits, progressions, composites, solar and lunar returns) that are found on most astrological sites.</p>
                <p>Sean will begin by digitalizing the foundation making both the Dreamspell Count and the Mayan Long Count available. We will then decide what options in what order to add, eventually making it a full service house system.</p>

        <section class="personal-intro" aria-labelledby="personal-intro-heading">
            <h2 id="personal-intro-heading">How Zuvuya Came to Be</h2>
            <div class="content-section">
                <p>In 1978 I bought my first two astrology books at the Theosophical Bookstore on Capitol Hill in Seattle Washington.</p>
                <p>Esoteric Astrology scribed by Alice Bailey and The Encyclopedia of Medical Astrology by H.L. Cornell M.D.</p>
                <p>Anyone can read Esoteric Astrology. There are no glyphs, no symbols, no astrological equations and it presents astrology in such a way as to turn most traditional views of astrology on its head. It was a good place to start.</p>
                <p>This was not the case with the Encyclopedia of Medical Astrology.</p>
                <p>The Encyclopedia is a mix of words, descriptions and astrological correlations none of which I had a clue about.</p>
                <p>Seattle was my home town, I knew the area well and went looking for an Astrology 101 class.</p>
                <p>Astrology Et Al had a storefront in the University District. I was shown the list of classes they were offering and Jeff's class caught my eye.</p>
                <p>Before I bought my first two astrology books I had been Gurdjieff-ing. My first husband and I were a part of a small Gurdjieff group and coming from that background a class on Evolutionary Astrology was much more appealing than the 101 series.</p>
                <p>I asked if I could sign up for Jeff's class and was seriously discouraged from doing so. It was suggested that until I took a basic course first I probably wouldn't get it.</p>
                <p>After seeing the write up about Jeff's class I had no intention of following that suggestion so after taking note of the time and day of Jeff's class I showed up. I asked Jeff if I could sit in on his class even with my limited understanding of astrology and he said fine.</p>
                <p>So I sat with a handful of other people. Jeff was 7 years away from catching the wave to fame, his classes were small and I asked a lot of questions that usually began with</p>
                <p>"What do you mean by……"</p>
                <p>Jeff and I became a couple shortly after.</p>
                <p>I attended numerous astrology conferences and met some very fine and diverse astrologers but I was never drawn to become a practicing professional astrologer.</p>
                <p>In 1985 Pluto: The Evolutionary Journey of the Soul was published. It was remarkably well received. Jeff became in high demand as a speaker, the Pluto book was translated into a number of languages and has become a fixture in the astrological hall of fame. Quite a success story for someone who had sustained severe trauma during his time in the Vietnam War.</p>
                <p>In 1988 we separated and I re-located to Northern California. In 1992 I was gifted the Dreamspell and found what I hadn't been able to find through astrology.</p>
                <p>My approach to studying the Dreamspell was similar to my approach in my self guided studies in Astrology. In 2024 I put the two together and created the Zuvuya House System. I think the Zuvuya House System is a natural progression in astrological thought and reduces the complexity of the Dreamspell. It demonstrates the relationship between the two cycles and by using the familiar astrological template introduces a way for astrologers and those who follow the Dreamspell to make some connections in a different way. It allows a broader basis for those who are drawn to the study, not necessarily the practice, for the unfolding of their own insights. So often we hear the call to "remember" who we really are and both Astrology and the Dreamspell offer a way to evoke this remembrance and validate experiences that arise from refined awareness.</p>

                <p>These positions enhance astrological configurations into an expanded view. They are not seen as causal agents but as resonant mirrors, reflecting the soul self within time memory.</p>

                <h3>Houses: Sacred Geometry of Memory</h3>
                <p>Zuvuya Houses are like a sacred geometry of memory guided by the 13 tones and 20 Galactic Tribes or Solar Seals. They act as living stages in the arising of awareness anchored in memory, movement and timing.</p>
                
                <h3>Planets: Resonant Mirrors</h3>
                <p>Traditional Astrology calculates planetary placements by time and place, producing a wheel that orientates the self in space. Zuvuya repositions planetary placements and orientates the self in time memory, with a spiral that begins with the soul's tone and tribe forming the inner ring of meaning.</p>
                
                <h3>Tones 1-13: Your Cosmic Music</h3>
                <p>"...to follow the musical analogy, while any day represents a particular tone or number (1-13), it also has its overtones. Properly tuned into, then, the quality of the day can lead to experiences in other octaves, in other dimensions of being. Though this view bears some analogy to astrology, the meaning is somewhat different because the numbers are cued to the galactic harmonics, rather than, or as well as, to planetary cycles."</p>
