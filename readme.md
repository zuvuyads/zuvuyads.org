The system provides insights without requiring traditional astrological time or location information.

## Features

- Integration of Mayan calendar day signs with Western zodiac
- Birth date-based pattern analysis
- Unique house system implementation
- Pattern visualization and interpretation
- User-friendly interface for date input
- Comprehensive pattern options display
- Cross-cultural astrological synthesis

## Mayan-Western Integration System

The system uniquely combines Mayan calendar elements with Western astrology through a sophisticated integration of glyphs, tones, and colors:

### Mayan Glyphs and Tribes
- Utilizes 20 Mayan tribes (Imix through Ahau) that correspond to specific positions in the chart
- Each tribe has an associated color:
  - Red: Imix, Chicchan, Cimi, Muluc, Oc
  - White: Ix, Men, Cib, Ik, Ahau
  - Blue: Akbal, Lamat, Ben, Etznab, Cauac
  - Yellow: Kan, Lamat, Ben, Etznab, Caban

### Tones and Zodiac Mapping
- Implements 13 tones that correspond to zodiac signs and houses:
  - Tone 1 = Aries
  - Tone 2 = Taurus
  - Tone 3 = Gemini
  - Tone 4 = Cancer
  - And so on through the zodiac

### Visual Integration
The chart consists of three main components:
1. Inner Circle: The zodiac wheel with 12 signs
2. First Outer Ring: Degrees for houses and planets
3. Second Outer Ring: Kin numbers (e.g., #95-106)

Each house division line is colored according to its associated Mayan tribe color, creating a unique visual pattern that combines both systems. Mayan tribe names are placed next to astrology glyphs inside the inner ring along the house cusps.
